## Design Principle #1

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
* Take the parts that vary and [[Pillars of OOP#2 - Encapsulation|encapsulate]] them in a class
	* You can later alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.
