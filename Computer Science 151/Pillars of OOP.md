## 2.1 - Classes and Objects

### Class

* Non primitive or user-defined data type in Java
* A blueprint or template for objects that share a set of attributes/properties/characters, a set of behavior/methods/actions
* It is a logical entity that does not occupy any space/memory - memory is allocated when we create an instance of the object
### Constructor

* Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name
* The constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects - no-arg constructor, no parameters
* Parameterized constructor = constructors that take some arguments
* Copy constructor = in Java we define copy constructor on our own
* Constructor chaining (this() - means the other constructor, super() - can be called in a child constructor

> [!example]
>```java
>class A { //implicitly extends object
> 	int m_x;
> 	int m_y;
> 	int m_z;
>
>	public A (int x, int y, int z) {
>		super();
>		m_x = x;
>		m_y = y;
>		m_z = z;
>		this(); // recursive constructor invocation error
>	}
>
>	public int A() { // not a constructor, compiles but not       // reccomended
>		return m_x;
>	}
>
>	public static void main(String[] args) {
>		A a = new A();
>	}
>}
>```
### Java Destructor

* The destructor is the opposite of the constructor
	* The destructor is used to delete or destroy the object that releases the resource occupied by the object
* There is no concept of destructor in Java
	* In place of the destructor, Java provides the garbage collector that works the same as the destructor
* The garbage collector is a program (thread) that runs on the JVM
	* Garbage Collection - memory is finite, objects allocated to the heap must …

### [[Recap#Object Oriented Programming|Pillars of Object Oriented Programming]]

#### 1 - Data Abstraction

> [!info] Definition
> The process of hiding certain (unnecessary) details and showing only essential information to the user
##### Achieving Abstraction

> [!info] Abstract Classes 
> * Partial abstraction
>```java
> abstract class A {
>	abstract void foo()
}
>```

> [!info] Interfaces
> * Full abstraction
>```java
>public interface Player {
>	public static final int League = 1;
>	abstract int move();
>}
>```

* Classes (not abstract, object can be instantiated from the class)
* Abstract Methods

> [!info] Marker Interface
> * Empty interface

> [!warning]
> An instance of an abstract class cannot be created
#### 2 - Encapsulation

> [!info] Definition
> Binding data and functions that manipulate data in a single unit (class)

* Enables data-hiding, [[Pillars of OOP#1 - Data Abstraction|abstraction]], [[Recap#Access Modifiers|data access control]]

#### 3 - Inheritance

> [!info] Definition
> Allows code reuse and enables polymorphism

> [!example]
>```java
>Student s = (Student) new Person(); // will compile, but explicit type casting is not reccommended
>s.getGpa(); // s is not a student so JVM will find an error
>```
#### 4 - Polymorphism

> [!info] Runtime polymorphism
> Method overriding
##### Method Overloading

> [!info] Compile time polymorphism
> Method overloading or operator overloading

* Multiple methods with the same name but different signatures
	* Different number or types of arguments
* We cannot overload by return type
	* void foo() and int foo()
* Static methods can be overloaded
* If I have the standard main() function with String[] args, jvm will detect that as an entry point
	* If I additionally make a main() function with different parameters or no parameters, it will just be a function
* Operator overloading
	* Java doesn't allow user-defined operators
	* Internally Java overloads some operator
	* + can be arithmetic addition or String concatenation
* Overload vs Override
	* Overloading
		* Compile time polymorphism
		* same class
	* Overriding
		* Run time polymorphism
		* Superclass/subclass
### Memory Regions

* Hard disk is too slow so the program is loaded to memory
* A program's memory usage typically includes 4 different regions
	* Code memory - program instructions are stored here
		* constants
	* Static memory
		* static fields
	* Heap/Stack
		* Order of adding data in stack and heap matters!!!
		* Stack (automatic memory)
			* local (instance) variables are allocated during a method call
			* a method call adds local variables to the stack, and a return removes them
			* like adding and removing dishes from a pile; hence the term "stack
			* automatically allocated and deallocated
			* contains references to heap
		* Heap (free store)
			* where the "new" operator allocates memory for objects
### Hierarchy

* Every constructor of every class begins with super(). If we do not provide super, it will automatically make an implicit no-args ctor call to the superclass
* If you call super and there is not a no arg constructor, then it will be a compiler error, other ctors will still work
