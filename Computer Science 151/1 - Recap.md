## `public static void main(String[] args)`

* public - Java’s main function requires a public access modifier
* static - Java’s main method is static, which means no instances need to be updated beforehand to invoke it
* void - Java’s main function is void, which means it does not return any value when it complete
* main - When the JVM starts a standalone application, the main method is the function that gets invoked
* String[] - An array of configuration parameters to be used by the application and can be passed into the main function as arguments.
* args - The configuration parameters passed into the main function in Java are typically named args

>[!info] Packages
>Mechanism required to fully specify class
* Allows use of classes with the same name in the same project
* Programmers can determine theat the classes are related
* Java uses filesystem directories to store packages
* Use Keyword import to import packages in Java

>[!info] Access Modifiers
>Used to set the accessibility (visibility) of classes, interfaces, variables, method, constructors, data members, and the setter methods

* Default (Package Private) - Declarations are visible only within the package
* Private - Declarations are visible within the class only
* Protected - Declarations are visible within the package or all subclasses
* Public - Declarations are visible everywhere

>[!info] Attributes / Class Attributes / Class Members / Class Fields
>* Represent variables of data within a class
>* Defines the properties of objects created from that class

```java
public class Rectangle extends Object {
	// properties, characteristics, member data/variables
	int m_length = 6;
	int m_width = 12;
	int m_area; // consistency/maintainence issue
	static String name = "rectangle";

	int area() {
		return m_length + m_width
		return area; // not good
	}
	
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return m_name;
	}

}
```

>[!info] Methods
>Blocks of code that perform specific tasks
>They encapsulate functionality to make code more organized and modular

* Static methods can be accessed without creating an object of the class
* Instance (non-static) methods can only be accessed via objects

### Object Oriented vs Procedural Programming
* Object Orientated Programming
	* Code is organized around objects, which are instances of classes that contain both data and methods
	* Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects
	* Objects can interact with each other through methods
	* Several advantages
		* provides a clear program structure
		* helps to keep Java code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes the code easier to maintain, modify, and debug
* Procedural Programming
	* Code is organized around procedures or functions but not objects
	* Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data
