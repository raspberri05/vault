## 3.1, 3.2 - Random Variables (rv)

> [!info] Definition
> For a given sample space $S$ of an experiment, a rv $X$ is a function that assigns every outcome in $S$ to exactly $1$ real number

![[rv|500]]

> [!example] Example 6
> Left ($L$), Right ($R$), Straight ($A$)
> Experiment terminates when car turns left
> Let $X=$ the number of cars observed
> Possible $X$ values?
> * The set of possible $X$ values is $\{1,2,3,4,…\}$
> * Outcomes/$X$ values
> 	* $L;21$
> 	* $AL,RL;2$
> 	* $RAL,RRL,ARL,AAL;3$
> * 

> [!tip] Notation
> $X,Y,Z,U,V$ are random variables
> $x,y,z,u,v$ are the values of the random variables
### Bernoulli Random Variables

> [!info] Definition
> A rv that has only 2 possible values

> [!Example]
> Flip a coin once
> * $X=\{^{1,Head}_{0,Tail}$
### Discrete Random Variable

> [!info] Definition
> A rv $X$ is discrete if its set of possible values is finite or countable infinite

#### Probability Distribution

> [!info] Definition
> The probability distribution or the probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete rv $X$ is the function $p_X(x)=P(X=x)$ for any real number $x$

> [!warning]
> $\sum\limits_xp_X(x)=1$

> [!example]
> Find the pmf: 
> 
> | $x$ | 2 | 5 | -10 | otherwise |
> | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- | -- |
> | $p_X(x)$ | $\frac{3}{36}=\frac{1}{12}$ | $\frac{18}{36}=\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{15}{36}=\frac{5}{12}$ | 0 |
> $p(x)=\{^{\frac{1}{12},x=2}_{…}$

> [!example] Example 12
> 1. $P(y\leq50)=1-P(y>50)=1-0.17=0.83$
> 2. $P(y>50)=0.17$
> 3. $P(y\leq49)=P(y\leq50)-P(y=50)=0.83-0.17=0.66$
> 4. $P(y\leq47=0.27)$

#### The Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)

> [!info] Definition
> Let $X$ be a discrete rv with the pmf $p(x)$ and the set of possible values $D$. The cdf of $X$, denoted by $F(x)$, is the function $F(x)=P(X\leq x)=\sum\limits_{y\leq x}p(y)$, where $x$ is any real number

> [!example]
> 
> | $x$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | otherwise |
> | - | - | - | - | - |
> | $p(x)$ | .5 | .3 | .2 | 0 |
> $F(0)=P(X\leq0)=p(0)=.5$
> $F(1)=P(X\leq1)=p(0)+p(1)=.8$
> $F(2)=P(X\leq2)=p(0)+p(1)+p(2)=1$

> [!example] Example 18
> ![[line1]]

> [!info] Proposition
> Let $X$ be a discrete rv with the cdf $F(x)$. Then for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a\leq b$,
> $P(X\leq b)=F(b)$
> $P(a\leq X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a^-)$ where $a^-$ is the largest possible value of $X$ that is less than $a$

> [!example] Example 18 (continued)
> $P(3\leq M\leq6)=p(3)+p(4)+p(5)+p(6)$
> $P(3\leq M\leq6)\neq F(6)-F(3)$
> $P(3\leq M \leq6)=F(6)-F(2)=1-\frac{1}{9}=\frac{8}{9}$
> $P(3<M\leq6)=F(6)-F(3)=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$
> $P(4<M)=1-P(M\leq3)=1-F(3)=1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$

## 3.3 - Expected Values

 > [!info] Definition
 > Let $X$ be a discrete rv with the $pmf$ $p(x)$ and the set of possible values $D$
 > The expected value of $X$, also known as the mean of $X$ is the following number $E(x)=\mu_x=\sum\limits_{x\in D}xp(x)$ provided that the sum exists
 
 > [!example] Example Game
 > Roll a fair six faced die
 > Let $X=$ profit/loss per game
 > 
 > | outcome | $x$ | $p(x)$ |
 > | ---------- | --- | -------- |
 > | $1,2,3,4$ | $-3$ | $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}=.667$ |
 > | $5,6$       | $+6$ | $\frac{1}{3}=.333$ |
 > $E(X)=-3(\frac{2}{3})+6(\frac{1}{3})=0$
 > Play the game 100 times
 > 
 > | outcome | count | relative freq. | $x$ |
 > | ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ----- |
 > | $1,2,3,4$ | $68$ | $.68$ | $-3$ |
 > | $5,6$       | $32$ | $.32$ | $+6$ |
 > Loss/profit per game:
 > $\frac{-3(68)+6(32)}{100}=-3(.68)+6(.32)=-.12$
 > $E(x)$ is the long-run average value of $X$ when the experiment is performed repeatedly

> [!info] Proposition
> If $h(x)$ is a function of rv $X$ with the $pmf$ $p_X(x)$ and the set of possible values $D$, then $E(h(X))=\sum\limits_{x\in D}h(x)p_X(x)$ provided that the sum exists

> [!info] Proposition
> Suppose a rv $X$ has $E(X)$. Let $a,b$ be any real numbers. Then, $E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b$
### Variance

> [!info] Definition
> Suppose rv $X$ with the $pmf$ $p(x)$ and the set of possible values $D$ has the mean $\mu$. The variance of $X$, denoted by by $V(X)$ or $\sigma^2$, is $V(X)=\sigma^2=\sum\limits_{x\in D}(x-\mu)^2p(x)$
> $V(X)=E((X-\mu)^2)$ provided that the sum exists

> [!info] Definition
> The standard deviation of $X$ is $\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^2}=\sqrt{V(X)}$

> [!info] Proposition
> Let $X$ be a rv with the mean $\mu$ and variance $V(X)$. For any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $V(aX+b)=a^2V(X)$, $\sigma_{aX+b}=|a|\sigma_X$

## 3.4 - The Binomial Probability Distribution
### Binomial Experiment
1. Sequence of $n$ smaller experiments called trials
2. Each trials can result in one of the same two possible outcomes (dichotomous trials) which are denoted as $S$, success, or $F$, failure. The assignment of these variables are arbitrary
3. Trials are independent
4. The probability of success $P(S)$ is constant from trial to trial, we denote this probability as $p$
5. The probability of failure $P(F)$ is constant from trial to trial, we denote this probability as $q=1-p$
The goal of such an experiment is to count the number of successes $X$

> [!example] Examples
> 1. Toss a coin (fair or unfair) 10 times and count the number of heads
> 2. The National Statistics claims that 30% of Americans can raise one eyebrow at a time. Ask any ten people whether they can lift one eyebrow at a time and record the number of those who answer yes

> [!example] Non Examples
> * A deck of 20 cards contains 10 red and 10 black cards
> 	* 5 cards are randomly chosen and the number of red cards is recorded
> * Roll a six faced die until a 6 appears
### Binomial Distribution

> [!info] Definition
> Consider a binomial experiment with $n$ trials where 
> $X=$the number of successes;
> $p=$the probability of a success in a single trial.
> Then $X$ has a binomial distribution and we write
> $$X~Bin(n,p)$$
> More notations
> $b(x;n,p),$ the $pmf$ of $X$
> $B(x;n,p),$ the $cdf$ of $x$

> [!example]
> A student is given a 3-questions multiple choice quiz. Each question has 4 possible answers of which only one is correct. Since the student has not been attending the class recently, he or she will be guessing on all 3 questions.
> Let $X$ be the number of correct answers. Construct the $pmf$ of the $RV$
> * $n=3$
> * Let $S=success=$the student picks the correction answer to a question
> * Then $p=P(S)=\frac{1}{4}=0.25$ and $1-p=P(F)=\frac{3}{4}=0.75$
> * Thus $X~Bin(3,0.25)$
> * The pmf of X

> $\frac{S}{1}, \frac{F}{2}, \frac{S}{3}… \frac{S}{n}$
> $x=0,1,2,…,n$

> * Probability that between 4 and 9 involve a fax message
> 	* $P(4\leq X\leq9)=B(9,25,.25)-B(3,25,.25)=.929-.096=.833$

## 3.5 - Hypergeometric and Negative Binomial Distributions
### Hypergeometric Distribution
#### Assumptions
1. The population or set to be sampled consists of $N$ individuals, objects, or elements (a *finite* population)
2. Each individual can be characterized as a success ($S$) or a failure ($F$), and there are $M$ successes in the population
3. A sample of $n$ individuals is selected without replacement in such a way that each subset of size $n$ is equally likely to be chosen
![[hypergeo]]
Let $X$ be the number of successes in the sample. 
Then we say that $X$ has a hypergeometric distribution with parameters 
$n$, sample size
$M$, the number of $S$'s in a population
$N$, the size of the population
Notation: $X~Hyp(n,M,N)$
The $pmf$ of $X$
* $h(x;n,M,N)=P(X=x)=\frac{(^M_x)*(_{n-x}^{N-M})}{(^N_n)}$
* for $x$ and integer satisfying max $(0,n-N+M)\leq x\leq min(n,M)$
* Note: $n-N+M=n-(N-M)$
* $(^M_x)=C_{x,M}$ is the number of ways to choose $x$ successes for the sample
* …
The $cdf$ of $X$
* $H(x;n,M,N)=P(X\leq x)$
* has no closed form
* has no table
> [!example]
> A deck of 30 cards contain 10 red and 20 black cards
> 5 cards are randomly chosen and the number of red cards is recorded
> The parameters are
> * $n=5$
> * $N=10+20=30$
> * $M=10$
> The $rv$ $X$ is the number of red cards in the selection
> * $P(X=3)=\frac{C_{3,10}*C_{(5-3),(30-10)}}{C_{5,30}}$
> * $=\frac{C_{3,10}*C_{2,20}}{C_{5,30}}$

> [!example] Example 70
> Two sections - first with 20 students, second with 30. Term project assigned, professor randomly ordered them before grading, consider the first 15 graded projects
> Given
> * $sec1=F, sec2=S$
> * $N=50,n=15,X=$ the number of projects from $sec2$
> * $X~hyp(n=15,M=30,N=50)$
> * Probability that exactly 10 projects are from $sec2$
> 	* $P(X=10)=h(10,15,30,50)$

> 	* $P$(at least 10 from $sec2$) + $P$(at least 10 from $sec1$)
> 	* $P(X\geq10)+P(15-X\geq10)$
> 	* $=P(X\geq10)+P(X\leq5)=.3798+\sum\limits_{x=0}^5h(x;n=15,M=30,N=50)$
> 	* $=.3798+.0140=.3938$

> 	* $V(X)=\frac{50-15}{50-1}*15*\frac{30}{50}*(1-\frac{30}{50})=2.5714$
> 	* $\sigma=1.60$
> * Mean and std dev of the number of projects not among these first 15 that are from the second section
> 	* $E(30-X)=30-E(X)=30-9=21$
> 	* $V(30-X)=(-1)^2V(X)=2.5714$
> 	* $\sigma=1.60$
#### Mean and Variance of $X$

> [!info] Proposition
> If $X~hyp(n,M,N)$, then
> $$E(X)=n*\frac{M}{N}$$
> $$V(X)=(\frac{N-n}{N-1})*n*\frac{M}{N}*(1-\frac{M}{N})$$

#### Rule of Thumb
if $\frac{n}{N}\leq0.5$ or $N\geq20n$, then
$$h(x;n,M,N)\approx b(x;n,\frac{M}{N})$$
assuming that $\frac{M}{N}$ is not too close to 0 or 1
### Negative Binomial Distribution
#### Assumption
1. The experiment consists of a sequence of independent trials
2. Each trial can result in either a success ($S$) or a failure ($F$)
3. The probability of success is constant from trial to trial, so $P(S)$ on trial $t)=p$ for $i=1,2,3$
4. The experiment continues (trials are performed) until a total of $r$ successes have been observed, where $r$ is a specified positive integer
Let $X$ be the number of failures that precede the $r$th success
Then $X$ is a negative binomial $RV$ and it has a negative binomial distribution with parameters $r$ and $p$
$X\sim nb(r,p)$
The $pmf$ is $nb(x;r,p)$
$nb(x;r,p)=(^{x+r-1}_{r-1})p^r(1-p)^x,x=0,1,2,3,…$
> [!example]
> Flip an unfair coin until exactly two heads are obtained
> …

> [!example]
> 10% of engines are defective. Randomly selected one at a time and tested.
> * Probability that first non-defective engine will be found on the second trial?
> 	* $S=$"non-defective engine selected"
> 	* $p=.9$
> 	* Let $X=$the number of defective engines before the first non-defective one
> 	* $r=1$
> 	* $X\sim nb(r=1,p=.9)$
> 	* $P(X=1)=(.1)(.9)=.09$
> * Probability that the third non-defective engine will be found on the fifth trial?
> 	* $Y=$the number of defective engines selected before the third non-defective one
> 	* $r=3$
> $Y\sim nb(r=3,p=.9)$
> $P(Y=2)=(^4_2)(.9)^3(.1)^2$

## 3.6 - Poisson Distribution, Poisson Process, and Approximation of Binomial Distribution
### Poisson Distributions
#### Assumptions
Consider time period $[0,t]$. The interval is divided into subintervals of width $\Delta t$.
Suppose $\Delta t$ is small. Then,
1. The probability that one event occurs during time period of length $\Delta t$ is approximately directly proportional to $\Delta t$. That is $P($one event$=(\alpha \Delta t)$
2. The probability that two or more events occur during the time period of length $\Delta t$ is approximately $0$
3. The number of events observed during any interval of length $\Delta t$ does not depend on the number of occurrences on the other subintervals
Let $K=$ the number of events during a time interval of length $t$.

> [!info] Proposition
> $K\sim Poi(\mu=\alpha t)$,
> $$P(K=k)=\frac{e^{-\alpha t}*(\alpha t)^K}{k!}$$
> where $k=0,1,2,…$
> $\alpha$ is the *rate of* the process. So, if $t=1(unit)$, then
> $$E(K)=\mu=\alpha * t$$
> $\alpha=$ the expected number of events in a unit of time

> [!Example] Example 92
> Automobiles arrive at a vehicle equipment inspection station according to a Poisson process with rate $\alpha=10$ per hour. Suppose that with probability $.5$ an arriving vehicle will have no equipment violations.
> $K=$ the number of cars during $t$ hr
> 1. What is the probability that exactly ten arrive during the hour and all ten have no violations?
> 	* $t=1 \Rightarrow K\sim Poi(\mu=\alpha * 1)\Rightarrow \mu=10$
> 	* Find $P(K=10$ and no violations) and $P($no violations | a car arrived at the station$)=.5$
> 	* $P(K=10 \cap$ all $10$ no violations)
> 	* $=P(K=10)*P($no violations | $K=10)$
> 	* $=\frac{e^{-10}*10^{10}}{10!}*(.5)^{10}=.00122$

> [!example] Example 86
> Organisms are present in ballast water discharged from a ship according to a Poisson process with a concentration of $10\: organisms/m^3$
> Given: $t=$ the volume of dischage in $m^3$ concentration = rate = $\alpha=10\: org./m^3$
> $K=$ the number of organisms in $tm^3$
> 1. What is the probability that one cubic meter of discharge contains at least 8 organisms?
> 	* $t=1\:m^3\Rightarrow k\sim Poi(\mu=10)$
> 	* $P(k\geq8)=1-F(7;\mu=10)=1-.22=\boxed{.78}$
> 1. What is the probability that the number of organisms in $1.5m^3$ of discharge exceeds its mean value by more than one standard deviation?
> 	* $t=1.5\Rightarrow k\sim Poi(\mu=15)$
> 	* $E(K)=V(K)=\mu=15\Rightarrow \sigma_K=\sqrt{15}=3.87$
> 	* $P(K>18.87)=1-F(18;15)=1-.819=\boxed{.181}$
