## 1.1 - Population, Samples, and Statistics

### Population

> [!info] Definition
> A set of all objects of interest in a statistical study

>[!example]
>The GPA of all SJSU students

### Sample

>[!info] Definition
>Any subset of a population

>[!example]
>The GPA of 4 random SJSU students

### Variable

>[!info] Definition
>Any characteristic whose value may change from one object to another in a statistical study

>[!note] 
>Use uppercase letters to name variables and lowercase letters to represent actual values of the variables
>

>[!example]
>$x = 5.2 (lb)$ 

### Discrete Variable
>[!info] Definition
>A numerical variable where its set of possible values either is finit or can be listed in an infinite sequence (one in which there is a first number, second number, and so on)

>[!example]
>The number of pets in a household

### Continuous Variable

>[!info] Continuous Definitio
>A numerical value where its possible values consist of an entire interval on the number line

>[!example]
>Hair length
### Collecting Data

>[!warning]
>Data should be properly collected
#### Sampling Techniques
* Simple Random Sampling
* Stratified Sampling
* Cluster Sampling
* Convenience Sampling
* Systematic Sampling

## 1.2 - Pictorial and Tabular Methods in Descriptive Statistics

### Stem and Leaf Plots

### Dot Plot

>[!info] Definition
>An attractive summary of numerical  data when the data set is reasonably small an there are relatively few distinct values

* Each observation is represented by a dot above the corresponding location on a number line for each occurrence
* Gives information about shape and various indicators
### Distribution and Histogram for Discrete Data

>[!info] Frequency
>The number of times that the value of a discrete variable occurs in the set

>[!info] Frequency Distribution
>Lists data values along with their corresponding frequencies or counts

>[!info] Histogram
>A bar graph based on the frequency distribution of data


## 1.3 - Measures of Location

>[!info] Categorical Data


## 1.4 - Measures of Variability

>[!info] Sample Variance
>$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_1 - x)^2}{n-1} = \frac{s_xx}{n-1}$ where $S_xx$ is called the sum of squares

>[!info] Sample Standard Deviation
>$s=\sqrt{s^2}$

### Finding the Sample Standard Deviation using the definition

* Find the sample mean $x$
* Compute the deviations $(x_1 - x)$
* Square the deviation $(x_1-x)^2$
* Add the squares of deviations $S_xx = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_1 - x)^2$
* Divide the result by the sample size n - 1
* Take the square root of the resulting number

>[!info] Shortcut Formula
>*see notes*

>[!info] Population Variance
>$\alpha^2 = \frac{\sum(x_1 - \mu)^2}{N}$, where $\mu$ is the population mean and $N$ is the size of the population

>[!info] Population Standard Deviation
>$\alpha = \sqrt{\alpha^2}$ 

>[!info] Properties of Sample Variance
>1. If $y_{1}= x_{1}+ c, y_{2}= x_{2}+ c, ...y_{n}= x_{n}+c$, then $s^{2_y=}s^2_x$ 
>2. If $y_{1}= cx_1,...y_{n}= cx_n$, then $s^2_y = c^2s^2_x,s_y=|c|s_x$
>Where $s^2_x$ is the sample variance of the x's ad $s^2_y$ is the sample variance of the y's

### Quartiles

* Divide an ordered data set (arranged in increasing order) into 4 groups with about 25 percent of the values in each group
* The second quartile $Q_2$ is the median of the data set
* The median of the lower half is $Q_1$ (lower fourth)
* The median of the upper half is $Q_3$ (upper fourth)
* Even observations - average the two values at each quartile split
* Odd observations - include median in both halves, the middle of each half becomes the fourth
* Interquartile Range (fourth spread)
	* $IQR$ or $f_s$
	* $IQR = f_{s}= Q_{3}- Q_1$
* Five Number Summary
	* $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$
	* Minimum value
	* Maximum Value
* Outliers
	* A mild outlier is if any observation is farther than $1.5f$ from the closest fourth
	* An extreme outlier is if any observation is farther than 3f from the nearest fourth
### Box Plot
1. Draw a number line
2. Plot the quartiles
3. Draw a box next to the number line that has a line at the $IQR$
4. Plot min and max
5. Draw ”whiskers” from min/max (excluding outliers, if any) to box
6. Draw an asterisks to represent outlier
#### Distribution Shape
* Rotate box plot $90$ degrees clockwise if vertical
* Match to shape of histogram (excluding outliers on box plot)
