## Mantle Convection
![[earth layers|500]]
![[asthenosphere|500]]
## Continental Drift
* Alfred Wegener's hypothesis in 1912
* Evidence
	* Fossils
	* Glacial Striations
	* Mountain Ranges
	* Tropical plant fossils in Norway
## Modern Evidence for Plate Tectonics
* Developed in 1960's 
* Crust is a rigid shell that slides around on a hot, gooey layer within the upper mantle called the asthenosphere (100-300km deep)
	* Two types
		* Oceanic (ex. Gabbro)
			* Dense, dark, thin
		* Continental (ex. Granite)
			* Not dense, light, thick
* Crust + upper-mantle = Lithosphere
	* Fractured shell, made of tectonic plates
	* 16 mm/yr (fast as fingernails grow), different directions
	* May contain both Oceanic and Continental Crust
* Locations of Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Mountain 
	* San Andreas Fault = Pacific + Atlantic plates
* Mid Ocean Ridges
* Age of Ocean Floor
* Magnetic Stripes
* GPS
## Slab
* Name for an oceanic plate
### Slab Pull
* at subduction zones
### Slab Push
* at divergent boundaries
## Types of Plate Boundaries
### Convergent
* crashing together
* Subduction zone
	* oceanic/continental
		* ![[trench_mantle_wedge_oceanic_continental|650]]
	* oceanic/oceanic
	* occur any time there is oceanic crust
	* large earthquakes volcanic arc, trench, mantle
* continental/continental
	* collisional
	* no subduction
	* Ex. Himalayas, Alps
	* Moderate earthquakes, a little bit of volcanism, huge mountains with folded rocks
### Divergent
* Lithosphere splits apart
* Partial melting of mantle rocks = basalt
* New oceanic crust formed
* Can happen in both oceanic and continental crust
* Crust is youngest right at boundary
* associated with minor amounts of volcanoes and shallow earthquakes
* shows cyclical changes in a magnetic field
* why a ridge?
### Transform
* sliding past each other
* strike-slip motion. neither pulling or pushing 
* moderate earthquakes, little, if any, volcanoes, moderate sized hills and valley (like the Santa Cruz mountains)
* San Andreas fault is between the Pacific (to the west) and North American (to the east) Plate and is right lateral
* Pacific plate moving north-westwards relative to North American Plate
* The lateral direction is the direction you would see the person on the other side moving if facing the fault
