## Continental Drift
* Alfred Wegener's hypothesis in 1912
* Evidence
	* Fossils
	* Glacial Striations
	* Mountain Ranges
	* Tropical plant fossils in Norway
## Modern Evidence for Plate Tectonics
* Developed in 1960's 
* Crust is a rigid shell that slides around on a hot, gooey layer within the upper mantle called the asthenosphere (100-300km deep)
	* Two types
		* Oceanic (ex. Gabbro)
			* Dense, dark, thin
		* Continental (ex. Granite)
			* Not dense, light, thick
* Types of plate boundaries
	* Convergence 
		* crashing together
	* Divergent
		* Lithosphere splits apart
		* Partial melting of mantle rocks = basalt
		* New oceanic crust formed
		* Can happen in both oceanic and continental crust
	* Transform
		* sliding past each other
* Crust + upper-mantle = Lithosphere
	* Fractured shell, made of tectonic plates
	* 16 mm/yr (fast as fingernails grow), different directions
	* May contain both Oceanic and Continental Crust
* Locations of Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Mountain 
	* San Andreas Fault = Pacific + Atlantic plates
* Mid Ocean Ridges
* Age of Ocean Floor
* Magnetic Stripes
* * GPS
