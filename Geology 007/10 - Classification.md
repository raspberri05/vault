## Taxonomy
* The practice of classifying living things (strictly speaking)
* Typically utilizes the Linnaean Classification
### Linnaean Classification
* Kingdom (broadest)
	* Phylum
		* Class
			* Order
				* Family
					* Genus
						* species (lowercase, most specific)
* Species names written as *Genus species* or abbreviated as *G. species*
### Phenotypic Classification
* Based on shared traits, this places similar looking organisms into distinct groups
* Phenotype (observed traits)
### Phylogenetic Classification
* Based on both evolutionary and genetic relationships
* Genotype (genetic traits)
### Clades
* Groupings of organisms based on their observed similar characteristics

![[clades]]
#### Monophyletic Group
* A complete group of organisms and their most recent ancestor
#### Paraphyletic Group
* Like monophyletic, except it *excludes* particular descendants
#### Polyphyletic Group
* A group of organisms that are similar, but do not share a direct common ancestor, like marine mammals
