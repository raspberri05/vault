## 2.1 - Sedimentary Rocks

>[!tip]
>Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface
### Formation
1. Weathering
	* A process where pre-existing rocks are broken down physically or chemically
		* Produces sediments
			* Loose rocks broken loose due to weathering
		* Physically
			* Physically broken into pieces
			* Ice wedging
			* Rocky debris is known as talus
			* Exfoliation
				* Cracks form due to release of surface pressure, parallel to the surface (perpendicular to plane of pressure release)
				* Pieces of the rock slide off, more cracks form
				* Known as a jointing pattern
			* Organic activity
				* When living things destroy rocks
			* Glacial Abrasion
				* Striations
				* Deep "U-Shaped" valleys
			* River Abrasion
			* Wave Abrasion
			* Wind abrasion
				* Aeolian
			* Thermal expansion and contraction
		* Chemically
			* Hydrolysis
				* Turns feldspar into clay
				* Absorption of water into the crystal structures of silicates and removal of some components of the silicate structure in solution (carried away in water)
				* Weathering of feldspar is typical
			* Oxidation
			* Dissolution
				* Dissolving of minerals and rocks
1. Deposition
	* Sediments are transported by wind, water, ice, gravity, etc, that come to rest and pile up somewhere
2. Lithification
	* Sediments are stuck together by the growth of new minerals between grains
### Clastic

>[!Info] Definition
>Fragments of other rocks

### Chemical

>[!info] Definition
>Crystals grown from a solution
