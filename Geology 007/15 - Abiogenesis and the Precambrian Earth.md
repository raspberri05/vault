## Precambrian Earth
* It is difficult to find rocks from the Precambrian period (4.6 BYA - 540 MYA)
## Living Things
* Practice chemical activity (metabolizes nutrients)
	* Metabolism
		* Breaking down of nutrients produces energy and compounds, such as proteins and DNA
* Can reproduce
* Reacts/adapts to its environment
### Differentiating Living and Non-living Things
 ![[living-nonliving]]
### Making Living Things
* Creating extremely complicated organic molecules from simple, non-organic ingredients
## Abiogenesis
* Spontaneous generation of life from non-living things
* Appropriate elements to build organic molecules (C, H, N, O, S, P)
* Energy to promote chemical reactions
	* Lightning, volcanoes, UV light
	* Can form simple molecules called Monomers
### Early Earth
* Rocky, barren landscapes
	* Nothing alive
* Strong tides
* Storms, lightning
* Volcanoes on land and underwater
* Sun rises and sets like 3 hours later
* Earthquakes and lava everywhere
* No $O_2$ in atmosphere
### Stanley Miller's Experiment
* Energy from sparks was able to synthesize all 20 of the amino acids that organic material is made from
* The goop in the vessel was called primordial soup
* Not alive; molecules too simple
### Microspheres
* Dry up the primordial soup
* Re-add water
* the proteins rearrange themselves into a shape
* these "microspheres" randomly divide
### Clay Grains
* Natural atoms line up in divots between crystalline structure
* Make it easier for chemical reactions to happen on these atoms
