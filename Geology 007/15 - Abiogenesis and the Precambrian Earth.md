## Precambrian Earth
* It is difficult to find rocks from the Precambrian period (4.6 BYA - 540 MYA)
## Living Things
* Practice chemical activity (metabolizes nutrients)
	* Metabolism
		* Breaking down of nutrients produces energy and compounds, such as proteins and DNA
* Can reproduce
* Reacts/adapts to its environment
### Differentiating Living and Non-living Things
 ![[living-nonliving]]
### Making Living Things
* Creating extremely complicated organic molecules from simple, non-organic ingredients
## Abiogenesis
* Spontaneous generation of life from non-living things
* Appropriate elements to build organic molecules (C, H, N, O, S, P)
* Energy to promote chemical reactions
	* Lightning, volcanoes, UV light
	* Can form simple molecules called Monomers
### Early Earth
* Rocky, barren landscapes
	* Nothing alive
* Strong tides
* Storms, lightning
* Volcanoes on land and underwater
* Sun rises and sets like 3 hours later
* Earthquakes and lava everywhere
* No $O_2$ in atmosphere
### Stanley Miller's Experiment
* Energy from sparks was able to synthesize all 20 of the amino acids that organic material is made from
* The goop in the vessel was called primordial soup
* Not alive; molecules too simple
### Microspheres
* Dry up the primordial soup
* Re-add water
* the proteins rearrange themselves into a shape
* these "microspheres" randomly divide
### Clay Grains
* Natural atoms line up in divots between crystalline structure
* Make it easier for chemical reactions to happen on these atoms
### Life Arose (3.8 - 4.0 BYA)
* Earliest form of life
* Simple bacteria (prokaryotes)
* Lived in shallow water
* Single celled
* Reproduced asexually
* Archaea vs Bacteria
	* Archaea can survive in extreme environments (ex. geothermal vents)
	* Split into branches billions of years ago but didn't change much more (punctuated equilibrium)
	* Cyanobacteria
		* first organism to perform photosynthesis
		* all other life arose from it
### The Great Oxygenation Event (2.3 BYA)
* Most of our atmosphere came from the gases that escaped from volcanoes
* Free oxygen is not one of them; oxygen came from photosynthesis
* Formed the ozone layer
* Abundant iron in the ocean reacted with oxygen and formed layers of hematite ($Fe_2O_3$) on the ocean floor
### Eukaryotes (2.1 BYA)
* Were single celled at first
* Membrane surrounding cell nucleus
* Reproduces sexually, aerobic (oxygenated - breathing)
* Endosymbiosis
	* Where one organism lives inside the other
	* What we think happened is that the mitochondria and chloroplasts invaded the main cell (or the other way around) and created a cell within a cell
### Multicellular Organisms (1.6 BYA)
* Replacement of cells that die
### Ediacaran Fauna (550 - 635 MYA)
* No bones or anything yet, all weird squishy small organisms
* No predatory practices, mostly filter feeders
