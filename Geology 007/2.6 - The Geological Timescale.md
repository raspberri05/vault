### Superposition
Superposition is used to see how life has changed through time because fossils are found in sedimentary rocks
### Principle of Fossil Secession
* Built on framework of the law of superposition
* "Fossil assemblages succeed one another through time in a regular and determinable order"
* Same fossils $\approx$ same age
### Principle of Lateral Continuity
* A sedimentary layer does not extend indefinitely, but the surface of the Earth does
### Correlation
* ...
* There is no place where **all** sediments of **all** ages are stacked up together
* Example: manually stitching together photos for a panoramic photo
### Hierarchy
* Temporal divisions of geologic time (early - late)
* Have corresponding set of rocks
* Eon (longest)
	* Era
		* Period
			* Epoch
				* Age
* Phanerozoic (542 my)
	* Cenozoic (66 my)
		* Quaternary (2.6 my)
			* Holocene (12,000 years)
				* Present Day
