## 1.1 - Minerals

>[!info] Definition
>* Naturally Occurring
>* Inorganic
>* Specific Chemical Composition
>* Solid
>* Crystalline
>	* Composed of atoms an molecules that are bonded to each other and arranged in a repeated geometric pattern
>	* Has a shape that reflects its internal crystalline arrangement

>[!info] Formation
>* Freezing from magma or lava
>* Grows from dissolved ions in water
>* Through chemical reactions of other minerals

## 1.2 - Igneous Rocks

>[!info] Definition
>* Chunks of frozen magma or lava
>* Crystalline

>[!info] Lava
>* Molten rock at Earth's surface
>* Forms volcanic igneous rocks

>[!info] Magma
>* Molten rock at Earth's surface
>* Forms plutonic igneous rocks

### From a liquid to a solid

* Through a process of freezing
* Over a range of temperatures due to rocks being composed of multiple minerals of multiple freezing points

### Types

* Aphanitic
	* Crystals too small to see,
	* Typical of volcanic rocks
	* Lava freezes quickly so crystals are smaller
* Phaneritic
	* Crystals visible to naked eye
	* Typical of plutonic rocks
	* Magma freezes slowly so crystals are bigger
* Porphyritic
	* Mixture of large and small crystals
	* Typical of both volcanic and plutonic rocks
* Vesicular
	* Foam, bubble-rich lava froze solid before bubbles could escape
	* Only volcanic rocks
* Pyroclastic
	* Composed of fragments of solid volcanic rock ejected from volcano, such as ash and rocks
	* Only volcanic rocks
* Glass
	* Forms when lava freezes too quickly for minerals to form
	* Only volcanic rock
	* Also known as obsidian

>[!info] Color Index
>The percentage of the rock made of dark colored minerals

### Felsic Minerals

* Not as dense
* Light in color
* No Fe and Mg
* Low melting temperatures
* Low color index
* High silica 65
* Lavas around 700 C

### Mafic Minerals

* Dense
* Dark in color
* Contains Fe and Mg (Ferromagnesian)
* High melting temperatures
* High color Index
* Low silica 52
* Lavas around 1200 C

### Igneous Equivalents

* A mafic magma will be a mafic lava at the surface
* A felsic magma will be a felsic lava at the surface
* Gabbro = basalt (oceanic crust)
* Granite = Rhyolite (continental crust)
