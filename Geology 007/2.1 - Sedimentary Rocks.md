## 2.1 - Sedimentary Rocks

> [!tip]
> Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface

### General Terms

> [!info] Grain (clast)
> Particle of rock, like a pebble or grain of sand

> [!info] Deposition
> The process by which gains settle and collect

> [!info] Lithification
> When sediments become stuck together
### Formation
#### Weathering

> [!info] Definition
A process where pre-existing rocks are broken down physically or chemically to produce sediments
##### Physically
* Ice wedging
	* Rocky debris is known as talus
		* Exfoliation
			* Cracks form due to release of surface pressure, parallel to the surface (perpendicular to plane of pressure release)
			* Pieces of the rock slide off, more cracks form
			* Known as a jointing pattern
			* Often happens in [[1 - Minerals and Igneous Rocks#^594ab3 |granite]]
		* Organic activity
			* When living things destroy rocks
		* Glacial Abrasion
			* Striations
			* Deep "U-Shaped" valleys
		* River Abrasion
		* Wave Abrasion
		* Wind abrasion
			* Aeolian
		* Thermal expansion and contraction
##### Chemically
* Hydrolysis
	* Turns feldspar into clay
	* Absorption of water into the crystal structures of silicates and removal of some components of the silicate structure in solution (carried away in water)
	* Weathering of feldspar is typical
* Oxidation
	* Common with metallic ions
* Dissolution
	* Dissolving of minerals and rocks
	* Common with calcite
	* Hard water, seashells, stagalmites
#### Deposition

> [!info] Definition
> Sediments are transported by wind, water, ice, gravity, etc, that come to rest and pile up somewhere
#### Lithification

> [!info] Definition
> Sediments are stuck together by the growth of new minerals between grains
### Clastic

> [!Info] Definition
> Fragments of other rocks
> Biological if it contains fossils/fossil fragments
### Chemical

> [!info] Definition
> Crystals grown from a solution

### Characteristics

#### Grain Rounding

> [!info] Definition
> "roundness" of a grain or average "roundness" of multiple grains

* Angular, Subangular, Sub-rounded, Rounded
* Result of abrasion

#### Sorting

> [!info] Definition
> Describes the range of grain sizes in a rock

### Changes over time

* Become more [[sorting|sorted]] over time
* Become [[2.1 - Sedimentary Rocks#Grain Rounding|rounded]] over time
* Become finer over time
	![[sorting|300]]
* Become more quartz rich
	* Quartz is quite stable, and survives the journey down a river more easily than other minerals
	* Quartz doesn't increase, but occurrence of other minerals decrease

### Types

#### [[#Clastic]]
* Conglomerate
	* Poorly [[#Sorting|sorted]] (mixture of silt, sand, pebbles, etc)
	* [[#Grain Rounding|Rounded]] grains
	* Formation
		* Rivers
		* Beaches (swash zones)
		* Glaciers
* Breccia
	* Poorly [[#Sorting|sorted]] (mixture of silt, sand, pebbles, etc)
	* [[#Grain Rounding|Angular]] grains
	* Formation
		* Faults
		* Landslides
		* Talus
* Sandstone
	* Well [[#Sorting|sorted]]
	* [[#Grain Rounding|Rounded]]
	* Formation
		* Beaches
		* Dunes
		* Rivers
	* Has mostly uniform layering
* Shale
	* Well [[#Sorting|sorted]]
	* [[#Grain Rounding|Rounded]] grains
	* Formation
		* Underwater
		* Rivers
		* Floodplains
	* Fossil preservation
		* Shale preserves great fossils
		* Fine details can be preserved quite well
			* Due to small grain size
#### [[#Chemical]]
* Old minerals dissolve into water, then reform back into crystals again
* Limestone
	* Composed of calcite crystals
	* Carbonate rock
	* Ancient fossil-rich limestone with fossil shells
	* Tiny crystalline calcite spheres formed in seawater in tropical regions
* Chert
	* Made of silica, mainly from plankton shells
* Coal
* Evaporites
	* Made of various mineral crystals
	* Has to do with what elements are present in the water
### Layers

* Sediments usually pile up in horizontal sheets on the Earth's surface
* These sheets stack up on top of each other over time
* Therefore, the deeper down you dig, the old the layers are
* Also known as "strata" or "bedding"

### Facies

![[facies|750]]

Rising sea level -> transgression
Falling sea level -> regression

### Cross Bedding Forms from Moving Sediments
* These rocks were deposited from flowing water or wind and have a distinctive pattern
* Forms from dunes and ripples
