## 2.1 - Sedimentary Rocks

> [!tip]
> Sedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface

### General Terms

> [!info] Grain (clast)
> Particle of rock, like a pebble or grain of sand

> [!info] Deposition
> The process by which gains settle and collect

> [!info] Lithification
> When sediments become stuck together
### Formation
#### Weathering

> [!info] Definition
A process where pre-existing rocks are broken down physically or chemically to produce sediments
##### Physically
* Ice wedging
	* Rocky debris is known as talus
		* Exfoliation
			* Cracks form due to release of surface pressure, parallel to the surface (perpendicular to plane of pressure release)
			* Pieces of the rock slide off, more cracks form
			* Known as a jointing pattern
			* Often happens in [[1 - Minerals and Igneous Rocks#^594ab3 |granite]]
		* Organic activity
			* When living things destroy rocks
		* Glacial Abrasion
			* Striations
			* Deep "U-Shaped" valleys
		* River Abrasion
		* Wave Abrasion
		* Wind abrasion
			* Aeolian
		* Thermal expansion and contraction
##### Chemically
* Hydrolysis
	* Turns feldspar into clay
	* Absorption of water into the crystal structures of silicates and removal of some components of the silicate structure in solution (carried away in water)
	* Weathering of feldspar is typical
* Oxidation
* Dissolution
	* Dissolving of minerals and rocks
#### Deposition

> [!info] Definition
> Sediments are transported by wind, water, ice, gravity, etc, that come to rest and pile up somewhere
#### Lithification

> [!info] Definition
> Sediments are stuck together by the growth of new minerals between grains
### Clastic

> [!Info] Definition
> Fragments of other rocks
> Biological if it contains fossils/fossil fragments
### Chemical

> [!info] Definition
> Crystals grown from a solution
