## Fossil
* Remains of past life
* Some fossils involve the original organic matter dissolving away and new minerals filling their place
* Other fossils can be made of the original organic material instead, like a sea shell
* Fossils form in different ways
* Latin: fossilis (something that has been dug up)

### Preservation

#### Factors

##### Environmental
* Grain size
	* smaller = better
* Rate of deposition
	* quicker = better
* Drying out, being frozen, trapped in amber, tar pits, etc
	* more = better
	* reduce amount of decay
##### Biological Factors
* Tissues
	* harder = better

### Types

#### Unaltered
* Still some original tissues
* Very well preserved
* Types
	* Frozen
		* Like freezing meat
	* Amber
		* Amber drips down
	* Tar
		* Tar Pits
			* Natural tar that rises up in springs along with water
			* Shale heated up and rose up
				* La Brea Tar Pits
	* Caves
		* Less things to disturb the organisms
		* Objects can be coated by calcite (from dripping water)
	* Mummification (drying out)
		* Things dry out and stop decaying
		* nothing to do with bandages or mummies
		* uncommon circumstances

#### Altered
* Original tissues get replaced by minerals or sediment (except for permineralization)
* Types
	* Permineralization / Petrification
		* Dissolved minerals, carried by groundwater, begin to grow crystals
		* The original, organic fossil material still remains
		* Common minerals include quartz and calcite
	* Replacement
		* The original mineral of a fossil get replaced by a new mineral
		* Mainly seashells, clam shells, etc (tissues that are already made of minerals to begin with)
	* Recrystallization
		* Little tiny organic crysals fuse together into much larger crystals due to heat and pressure during metamorphism
		* Or the minerals dissolve then reform again into newer, larger crystals
		* This recrystallizes the original material of the shell and damages it, causing it to lose a lot of its detail
	* Carbonization
		* When a leaf of insect, for example, fossilize, they break down into simple organic compounds that diffuse away into the surrounding rock
		* The carbon from the fossil cannot move through the rock easily, so it just stays behind. This leaves a shadow-like effect

### Fossil Record

* All the fossils we have found so far, put in order of their formation
* Found in stacks of sedimentary rocks across the world
* We've only scratched the surface
* Most organisms don't fossilize
* Of those that do, its mainly hard tissues like bones and shells and teeth
* Most of these fossils will remain deeply buried in the ground, and we will never find them
* We only find fossils when they present themselves to us
* We randomly come across fossils, then explore further to find more of them
* Not typically an entire skeleton, just a few bone fragments or teeth
* The layers of the Earth can be read like pages of a book
* The distribution of fossils is not random
