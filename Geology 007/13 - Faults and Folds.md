## Crust
* The crust varies in thickness, as we learn with plate tectonics
### Stress
* A force that acts on rocks
* Tension (stretching)
* Compression (squishing)
* Shear (twisting)
### Strain
* Any change in shape that results from stress
...
### Elastic
* Strain goes away when stress goes away (recoverable)
### Plastic
### Brittle
* Upper crust (its also elastic)
### Ductile
### The Brittle-Ductile Transition
* A depth in the crust that separates rocks that break from rocks that squish
* Rocks in the lower crust will become strained, and the strain is permanent (non-recoverable strain)
### Folds
* During compression, folding allows the crust to *shorten* (become strained)
* Anticlines (upward folds)
* Synclines (downward folds)
### Block Diagrams
* Foot Wall is below the fault
* Hanging wall is above the fault
### Quantifying plana features in a 3D space
* Dip is the compass direction that a lane tilts towards.
* Strike is the compass direction of a line that forms from the intersection of a tilting plane with a second, horizontal plane
