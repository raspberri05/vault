## Crust
* The crust varies in thickness, as we learn with plate tectonics
### Stress
* A force that acts on rocks
* Tension (stretching)
* Compression (squishing)
* Shear (twisting)
### Strain
* Any change in shape that results from stress
â€¦
### Elastic
* Strain goes away when stress goes away (recoverable)
### Plastic
### Brittle
* Upper crust (its also elastic)
### Ductile
### The Brittle-Ductile Transition
* A depth in the crust that separates rocks that break from rocks that squish
* Rocks in the lower crust will become strained, and the strain is permanent (non-recoverable strain)
### Folds
* During compression, folding allows the crust to *shorten* (become strained)
* Anticlines (upward folds)
* Synclines (downward folds)
### Block Diagrams
* Foot Wall is below the fault
* Hanging wall is above the fault
### Quantifying Plana Features in a 3D Space
* Dip is the compass direction that a lane tilts towards.
* Strike is the compass direction of a line that forms from the intersection of a tilting plane with a second, horizontal plane
### Faults

#### Reverse Fault
* Compression
* Hanging wall moves up and in relative to foot wall
![[reverse fault]]
#### Normal Fault
* Compression
* Hanging wall move down and out relative to foot wall
![[normal fault]]
#### Transform Fault (Strike-Slip Fault)
* Tension
![[transform]]
