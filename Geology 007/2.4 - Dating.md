## Absolute Dating

* All you need is a tiny sample of material (mineral, bone) no larger than a grain of rice
* Gives us the true "age" of a fossil or rock
* Mainly organic tissue or igneous crystals
* Measure the amount of unstable isotopes that have "decayed" to figure our age
### Isotopes

> [!info] Definition
> Atoms with a different number of neutrons than protons

* The number of protons (the atomic number) is fixed for any element
* The number of neutrons can vary

Parent isotope $\Rightarrow$ daughter isotope

> [!example]
> Uranium $\Rightarrow$ lead
> The reaction spits out two neutrons
> In a nuclear bomb, these uranium atoms are close together, the emitted neutrons cause other Uranium atoms to decay
#### Half Life

> | Time in Microwave | Unpopped | Popped |

> | 9                 | 12.5%    | 87.5%  |
> The half life is 3 minutes

## Relative Dating

> [!info] Definition
> Places events in geologic history in the proper order

* Mainly [[2.1 - Sedimentary Rocks|sedimentary rocks]] and [[1.2 - Igneous Rocks#^915c87|lava flow]]
### Superposition

> [!info] Definition
> The youngest rocks are at the top, oldest at the bottom

### Cross Cutting Relationships

> [!info] Definition
> Geologic features that cut through and across rocks are younger than those rocks

* Mostly faults and igneous intrusions

![[geo time fault]]
*C flat due to erosion after earthquake*

### Law of Inclusions

> [!info] Definition
> Rocks embedded in other rocks are **older** than those rocks they are embedded in

* In other words, the ingredients of something are older than the thing itself

### Law of Original Horizontality

### Law of Unconformities

#### Disconformity
![[disconformity]]
#### Angular Unconformity
![[angular uncoonformity]]
#### Non-Conformity
![[non-conformity]]
