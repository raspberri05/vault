## Central Claim of Evolution
* Organisms descend with modification from their ancestors
### Descent
* Formation of newer generations
### Correlation
* Correlation of strata and faunal succession show that there have been organisms in the past that aren't alive today
### Mechanism for Change
* We've known for tens of thousands of years that we can cause changes in a species
### Artificial Selection
* Matching up individuals of a species with particular traits to accentuate that trait
#### Cultivation
* Example
	* Many vegetables were creating from inbreeding mustard plants
		* Broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, etc
### Natural Selection
* Unlike artificial selection, there is no goal in mind
	* Organisms either live to reproduce or die and their traits are weeded out
* Assumes a population of species has natural variation
* Particular individuals have traits that enable them to survive and reproduce more commonly
* These traits spread as they are favored by each new generation
#### Source of Variation
* Mutations
* When DNA replicates, sometimes copying errors occur and new traits appear
* Mutation
	* Beneficial
	* Detrimental
	* Neutral
* All depends on the environment
* Evolution is the accumulation of these mutations
#### Importance of Variation
* The spectrum of traits seen in a species
* Variation results in a broad assortment of traits in the population
* It's more likely that, if the environment changes, at least some members of that group will have the needed traits to survive and reproduce
#### Survival of the Fittest
* Not necessarily big or strong
* Ex. sloths
### Modern Genetics
* DNA is a complex molecule that stores genetic information
* It's where our traits come from
* DNA is made up of a handful of chemical letters
* Genes
	* Units of heredity
	* A few hundred to a few million nucleobases in a single gene
	* We have two copies of each gene, one from each parent
	* Different forms of a gene are called "alleles"
	* Chromosomes are made of two strands of DNA that are coiled tightly around a histone
	* 23 pairs of chromosomes in a human cell nucleus
### Inheritance
* Half chromosome from each parent
### Mutations
* Sometimes when DNA copies during cell division, errors occurred
* Can be spontaneous, or caused by chemicals or radiation
* Leads to variation in a species, and to new traits
### Patterns of Evolution

#### Divergent Evolution
* Ancestral species gives rise to many diverse species
* Descendants differ greatly from their ancestors and from each other in many cases
#### Convergent Evolution
* Development of similar characteristics in distantly-related organisms
#### Parallel Evolution
* Development of similar characteristics in closely-related organisms
