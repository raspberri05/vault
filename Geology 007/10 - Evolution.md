## Central Claim of Evolution
* Organisms descend with modification from their ancestors
### Descent
* Formation of newer generations
### Correlation
* Correlation of strata and faunal succession show that there have been organisms in the past that aren't alive today
### Mechanism for Change
* We've known for tens of thousands of years that we can cause changes in a species
### Artificial Selection
* Matching up individuals of a species with particular traits to accentuate that trait
#### Cultivation
* Example
	* Many vegetables were creating from inbreeding mustard plants
		* Broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, etc
### Natural Selection
* Unlike artificial selection, there is no goal in mind
	* Organisms either live to reproduce or die and their traits are weeded out
* Assumes a population of species has natural variation
* Particular individuals have traits that enable them to survive and reproduce more commonly
* These traits spread as they are favored by each new generation
#### Source of Variation
* Mutations
* When DNA replicates, sometimes copying errors occur and new traits appear
* Mutation
	* Beneficial
	* Detrimental
	* Neutral
* All depends on the environment
* Evolution is the accumulation of these mutations
