## Central Claim of Evolution
* Organisms descend with modification from their ancestors
### Descent
* Formation of newer generations
### Correlation
* Correlation of strata and faunal succession show that there have been organisms in the past that aren't alive today
### Mechanism for Change
* We've known for tens of thousands of years that we can cause changes in a species
### Artificial Selection
* Matching up individuals of a species with particular traits to accentuate that trait
#### Cultivation
* Example
	* Many vegetables were creating from inbreeding mustard plants
		* Broccoli, brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, etc
