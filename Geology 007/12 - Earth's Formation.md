## The Sun
### Nuclear Fusion
* Process that powers the sun
![[sun fusion|500]]
* Once the hydrogen runs out, the sun shrinks
* Helium that is there fuses into carbon, causes the sun to expand into a red giant
* It will then consume the inner planets, in 4-5 billion years
* Eventually leaves behind a very dense ball of carbon called a white dwarf when the red giant dissipates
* In bigger stars
	* H -> He -> C -> â€¦..
	* The fusion keeps going into heavier elements
	* It will implode (supernova)
	* Leaves behind a cloud of dust, gas, and tiny rocks
	* Eventually clumps back together (this is what created our solar system)
## Solar System Formation
1. Supernova leaves behind a cloud of dust, gas, tiny rocks
2. Cloud flattens into a spinning disc
3. Sun forms in the middle of the disc (circumstellar disk)
4. Solar wind differentiates disc
5. Disc separates into rings
6. Each ring accretes into a planet
